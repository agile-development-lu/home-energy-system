# Smart Home Energy Management System

This repository contains a modular, extensible framework for managing and optimizing energy usage in a smart home environment. The system collects data from various sources, predicts energy consumption and production, executes energy management strategies, and enables peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading. The goal is to help homeowners reduce costs, increase energy efficiency, and potentially earn revenue from surplus energy.

## Features

- **Data Collection**: Gather real-time or historical data on energy consumption, generation, and external factors (e.g., weather).
- **Energy Management**: Dynamically adjust device usage schedules, battery storage, and other parameters to optimize energy usage.
- **Prediction**: Forecast future energy needs and generation based on historical data and external inputs (e.g., weather forecasts).
- **Peer-to-Peer Trading**: Trade surplus energy with neighboring homes or community microgrids to maximize cost savings or profit.
- **Modular Design**: Agents are designed to be independent, making it easy to extend or replace components as needed.

- **agents/**  
  - **data_collection_agent.py**: Interfaces with sensors, APIs, or data sources to collect consumption/generation data.  
  - **energy_management_agent.py**: Implements logic for optimizing energy usage (e.g., scheduling, load shifting).  
  - **p2p_trading_agent.py**: Manages surplus energy trading between multiple participants.  
  - **prediction_agent.py**: Uses machine learning or statistical methods to forecast energy consumption/production.

- **models/**  
  - Contains machine learning or statistical models used by the prediction agent.  
  - You can store pre-trained models or training scripts here.

- **utils/**  
  - **config.py**: Centralized configuration (e.g., database credentials, API keys, environment settings).  
  - **data_loader.py**: Helper functions to load and preprocess data from various sources.  
  - **db_handler.py**: Handles database connections, queries, and data storage.

- **run.py**  
  - Main entry point to run the system. Instantiates agents, loads configuration, and orchestrates the workflow.

- **test.py**  
  - Basic test script or entry point for unit tests. Ensures system components work as expected.

- **LICENSE**  
  - The open-source license governing this project.
